Image Captioning is the technique in which automatic descriptions are generated for an image
I have used Flickr8k dataset. 
MS-COCO and Flickr30K are other datasets that you can use.
Flickr8K has 6000 training images, 1000 validation images and 1000 testing images. Each image has 5 captions describing it.
