Image Captioning is the technique in which automatic descriptions are generated for an image
I have used Flickr8k dataset. 
MS-COCO and Flickr30K are other datasets that you can use.
Flickr8K has 6000 training images, 1000 validation images and 1000 testing images. Each image has 5 captions describing it.

Third eye is an assistant for visually impaired which narrates the description of the scene. Functionalities provided by our system are Image caption generation, Visual Question Answering, Face and emotion recognition, text to speech for books, sign boards and restaurant menu, outdoor navigation with GPS and traffic light color interpretation.
